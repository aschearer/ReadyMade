# ReadyMade

This is project aims to explore the [Component][1] design pattern for game
development. The goal is split separate concerns into distinct components so
that each component is responsible for one thing. Another goal is to define a
set of re-usable components which can be shared across multiple game objects.
Finally, if possible it should be possible to define entities through XML or
script so that each game object is created in a data-driven manner.
